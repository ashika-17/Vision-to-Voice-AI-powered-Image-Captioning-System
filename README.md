Vision to Voice: AI-Powered Image Captioning with Audio Assistance
  Vision to Voice is a real-world AI application that transforms visual content into meaningful spoken descriptions. Using deep learning models, this system automatically generates captions for uploaded or real-time captured images and converts those captions into speech in English, Tamil, or Hindi — helping bridge the communication gap for visually impaired users or language learners.

How It Works
  Choose Input: Upload an image or capture one in real-time via webcam.

  Caption Generation: The BLIP model processes the image and generates a descriptive sentence.

  Language Selection: Choose from English, Tamil, or Hindi.

  Audio Output: The caption is translated (if needed) and played aloud using gTTS.

Example:
Input: An image of a cat lying on a sofa

Generated Caption: "A cat sitting on a couch in a living room"

Selected Language: Tamil

Audio Output: "ஒரு பசுமை நிற பூனைソபாவில் அமர்ந்துள்ளது..."
